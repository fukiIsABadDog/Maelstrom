# Can I run this app?
Yes you can! 

## Step one: 
Make sure you have a Database! If you don't have one you can pick up one here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads
There is plenty of documentation one how to set this up out on the web.

## Step two:
Clone the repository! I recommend starting this project in VS and not VScode as it has more support for these kinds of projects out the box.

## step three:
Use SQLServer Object explorer to find your Database, if it is not there you may have to create one. Look for the connection string in the properties tab and copy it for use later.

## step four:
Create an appsettings.Json file with the connection string. (Note: I will post more detailed images in a future version of this walk through).
Pase the connection string you justed copied from the SqlServer Object Explorer properties tab.

## step five:
Press F5 and run the app! It should be working if not there may be some naming issues that the debugger should be able to display to you.
